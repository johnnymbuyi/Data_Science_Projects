# Data_Science_Projects
All Personal data science projects that I have completed

### Hotel Cancellation
Developed bi-predict models to predict the likelihood of cancellation for an upcoming booking based on customer profile. This approach can be used to address the challenges of a business problem that requires classification in order to target and maximise values and/or accounts, such as churn prediction. 
- Logistic Regression and Neural Network models were adopted and applied to this problem. 
- Technology Stack: Python, Jupiter Notebooks, Matplotlib, SciKit-Learn, TensorFlow.

### Time Series Forecast
Developed forecast models to support business problems that require planning of demand and supply, such as budgets and demand planning. 
- SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) models were adopted and applied to this time series prediction problem. 
- Technology Stack: Python, Jupiter Notebooks, Matplotlib, Stats models, TensorFlow.
