# Time Series Forecast with SARIMA and RNN models

### Developing a forecast model to support planning of demand and supply

In this project, SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) models are adopted and applied to a time series prediction problem. This process can be applied to business situations, such as: budgets and demand planning.
